        <p>Montserrat is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed by Argentine graphic designer Julieta Ulanovsky and released in 2011. It was inspired by posters, signs and painted windows from the first half of the twentieth century, seen in the historic Montserrat neighbourhood of Buenos Aires.

            The project was started in 2010 by Ulanovsky and was released through the Google Fonts catalogue in 2011. Montserrat has become increasingly popular among web designers, and it is used on over 15 million websites.
            
            Featuring a large x-height, short descenders and wide apertures, this typeface achieves high legibility even in small sizes.
            
            Montserrat has been developed into a large family, consisting of nine weights (from Thin to Black), a set of alternate characters, a distinctive Subrayada (underlined) variant, and support for the Cyrillic character set.
            
            According to lead designer Ulanovsky, it is a functional and contemporary alphabet, with uses ranging from publishing to the corporative world. She refers to it as a "geometric typeface with bold optical adjustments."</p>
